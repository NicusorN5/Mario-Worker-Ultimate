# Mario Worker Ultimate

## What is this?

Mario Worker Ultimate is a remake and customizable version of Mario Worker 1.1 originally made by Buziol Games. It (is planned to*) support LUA scripting, custom entities, blocks, et cetera.

## How to build using VS 2022

1.) Install [vpckg](https://vcpkg.io/en/)

2.) Install Raylib using vcpkg: `vcpkg install raylib`

2.) Get sprite and sounds from the ~~lastest working release~~ (they have to be remade).

3.) Build and run the project.
